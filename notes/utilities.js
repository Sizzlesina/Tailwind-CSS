/*
* Display:
@ 1- block => You can still change the height and width of the element:
++ Example: div - h1 - p - li - section

@ 2- inline => There going to be displayed on the same line and you cant change the height and width of it:
++ Example: a - span - img - em - strong - i - small

@ 3- inline-block => Its in the middle of block and inline and we can change the height and width of it

@ 4- none => This display is not exist in Tailwind instead we have "invisible" and "hidden":

++ Invisible : it will not show the element but the place of the element still exists

++ Hidden : it will completely remove the element
@ 5- flex 
@ grid

* Flex:
@ - when we want to use the flex display we should have an container and then set the "flex" class for that container to behave as as a flex container

@ - flex-col is used to positioning flex items vertically and flex-row is used for positioning flex items horizontally

@ As simple as the name justify-(utility) is used for justify content of the flex items and items-(utility) is used for align items of the flex items
